	As a bonus action, you can command the familiar to take the Attack action.
	The familiar's weapon attacks are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks.

Your exposure to the Feywild's magic has changed you, granting you the following benefits:
Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
You learn the **Misty Step** spell and one 1st-level spell of your choice. The 1st-level spell must be from the Divination or Enchantment school of magic. You can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either of these spells in this way, you can’t cast that spell in this way again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spells’ spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.
